# Close-Price-Forecasting

This project presents a computational approach for predicting the stock price. A neural network based model has been used in predicting the direction of the movement of the closing value of the Nifty 50index. The model presented in the project also confirms that it can be used to predict price index value of the stock market. 

After studying the various features of the network model, an optimal model is proposed for the purpose of forecasting. The model has used the preprocessed data set of closing value of Nifty 50 Index. The data set encompassed the trading days from 1st January, 2001 to 31st December, 2017. 

In the project, the model has been validated across 5 years of the trading days. Accuracy of the performance of the neural network is compared using various out of sample performance measures. The average performance of the network in terms of accuracy in predicting the direction of the closing value of the index is reported at 74%. 

## Software and Libraries

Python programming was executed using the Anaconda software, as Python as a programming language itself must be installed first and then there are many packages to install. Anaconda has all the packages already installed it has the most useful packages for Mathematics, Science and Engineering already inbuilt installed. Through our project, we explored various libraries of python software for various tasks like data extraction, manipulation, mathematical calculations, visualization, valuation metrics, etc.
 
++NsePy++:   This library is a very useful and powerful tool in extracting historical data of NSE. This is a great tool to large amounts of historical data and also various types like Futures data, Options data and also the strike prices along with expiry can be extracted using NsePy library
.
For the data to be stored in a proper structured format and mathematical calculations and manipulations, Pandas and NumPy library were the most useful tool and made the further analysis easy.
 
Scikit Learn:  This is one of the most useful data analysis library which is extensively used for machine learning techniques where various machine learning techniques like regression, classification, clustering, multivariate techniques and many more can be implemented. This library has all the algorithms essential for model building, evaluation metrics and also validation techniques like k-fold cross validation can be done using this.
 
Keras: It is an open source neural network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of MXNet, Deeplearning4j, TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit or Theano.
